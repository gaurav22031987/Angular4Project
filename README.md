# Angular4-Features


Template is now ng-template: 
The template tag is now deprecated: you should use the ng-template tag instead. It still works though. Now Angular has its own template tag: ng-template. You will have a warning if you use the deprecated template somewhere when you update to Angular 4, so it will be easy to spot them.

Pipes: 
Angular 4 introduced a new titlecase pipe. It changes the first letter of each word into uppercase:

Http:

Router:

Instead of using params or queryParams, you should now use param or queryParam, because they offer get() for retrieving one value and getAll() to retrieve all values (as query parameters can have multiple values for example).

I guess I have covered all the major changes that has been introduced in Angular 4.
